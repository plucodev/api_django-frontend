# Contact Managment Application 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Context API.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Create, Update, Delete and Read contacts. 
<a href="https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=contact-list&preview">Check it out here!</a>

Please use Context API for this with a Provider and Consumers.

How to start?
Clone the repository with the boilerplate, it contains no real functionalities 
but it has 99.99% of the HTML/CSS/Context boilerplate setup that you'll need for the project, 
allowing you to focus on the functionality.

The project is divided in:
Two different views:
Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
AddContact: It's just a form that you can use to create or update contatcs.
There is one additional component:
ContactCard: Ideal component to display just one contact.

Expected functionalities
You have to add the code needed to make your application create, edit, 
and delete contacts from the list.
(Optional but is a plus) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the 
Modal component for that.
